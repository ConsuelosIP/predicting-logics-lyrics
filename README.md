# Predicting Logic's Lyrics with Machine Learning
Using simple machine-learning concepts, we can analyze Logicâ€™s style of hip-hop and predict lyrics he would actually write.
  
Written for and in Dennis Sun's DATA 301 class at Cal Poly SLO. Absolutely **no permission** is given to any person to use or submit any of this code for any reason. I had a fantastic time trying to figure out this lab and simply wish to document and display this work for educational, personal, and employment-related reasons.
  
**Language:**
  + Python 3 (Jupyter Notebook)
  
**Libraries:**
  + `requests`
  + `time`
  + `bs4` ([documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc))
  + `pickle`
  + `random`
  
**Tasks:**
  - [x] Break down all code into gists.
  - [x] Make Python scripts for each main section of code.
  - [x] Create a Jupyter Notebook. 
  - [ ] Publish the Jupyter Notebook as a Medium post.
  - [ ] Implement a recurrent neural network instead of a Markov chain.
  - [ ] Figure out how to generate lines that consistently rhyme with each other.
